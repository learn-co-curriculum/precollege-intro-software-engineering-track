##Tips for Day 1

[Tips](https://docs.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/document/d/1q9xnXgAWXJPaBx358NytoHF4yKStTCphlVpFpazGkjM)

###Before Class One:
+ Find out how many kids need computers / set up computers
+ Make sure kids are on Shortpath
+ Send Welcome email
+ Make sure all students have been added to GitHub team (GitHub team is made automatically when Ironboard batch is created and will have the same name, e.g. after-school-000)
+ Deploy labs and check them:
+ Make sure that team repository has been created (something like https://GitHub.com/flatiron-school-ironboard/hs-ruby-assessment-after-school-advanced-000).
+ Make sure you have a credit card to order pizza lunch (Elana can pre-order from Williamsburg Pizza but you should call the morning of class to make sure it is coming)

###Day Before:
+ Make sure kids have access to building
+ Make sure students know lunch isn't provided
+ Review best practices around instruction strategies and tactics
+ Prepare energetic start to class
+ Full walkthrough of the entire lesson/labs
+ Make key points list of learning objectives
+ Make sure all labs are deployed
+ Make sure surveys are printed or link to survey has been added to Ironboard 

###Day of:
+ Have music playing when students enter the class
+ Schedule on board before kids go in
+ hand out surveys at the end of class (or direct students to survey on Ironboard)
+ deliver REALLY energetic start to class
+ summarize what learned during class and deliver teaser for next week
+ actively use students names during class
+ break up lecture with interactivity
