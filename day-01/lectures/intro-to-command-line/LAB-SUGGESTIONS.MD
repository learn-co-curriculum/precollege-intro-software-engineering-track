# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Find The Missing Pet` lab is great practice for students to get comfortable moving around the terminal and learning about absolute v. relative paths. It's important to let students figure things out on their own (if they use cd to move around, and then move the image back each level manually before using paths), as long as they all end up using absolute or relative paths. This lab also has a test file `test.rb` that students can use to check their work. Just run in terminal `ruby test.rb` and the rests will run. Animals that are in the right place will appear in green.

+ `Sinatra Organizer` lab is more practice moving files that is less redundant for students. It can get stick because they don't know the Sinatra file structure, but early exposure is good. Nice to preface with "This structure will make way more sense next week".

+ `Bash Script` lab is an advanced lab for students who are really familiar with the terminal. Bash scripting is a language for writing bash commands in a file, and then running that file in terminal, so you can plan your actions before you take them.
