# DAY-02 Git and GitHub 

_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

## SWBATs
+ Understand the purpose of GitHub and learn how to fork and clone repositories.
+ Understand the purpose of Git and GitHub, commit locally, and push to a remote repository.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ How many of you have used Google Docs? It's a great way to store documents online and makes it easy to collaborate with other people. It works best for files like word documents and spreadsheets, but it isn't equipped to store code. Thankfully, there's GitHub, which is basically the Google Docs of code.
+ When you click the Nitrous button on Learn, this process of forking and cloning is automatically happening for you. Forking and cloning is a huge part of a developer workflow, so we wanted to teach you guys how that button actually works

## Lesson Plan
+ Navigate to Week 2 > Git and GitHub > Study Guide 
  + We'll use this to get code from GitHub and bring it down to our computers.
+ Click "Fork this lab" link to open GitHub repository.
  + Explain what a repository is.
+ Click "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page.
  + Explain what forking is. (Like making a photocopy of a handout.)
+ At "Where should we fork this repository?" popup, select own account.
+ GitHub then redirects to a page with your username/lab-name in URL. 
  + Your account now has a copy on GitHub.
  + You can't edit it on your computer in Sublime Text just yet.
+ Explain what cloning a repository is.
+ On the right sidebar, find the "clone URL" input box, and make sure that it says "HTTPS clone URL." 
  + Copy the URL.
+ In terminal, in your Development directory, enter `git clone` and paste the URL.
+ Terminal will prompt you to enter your username and password. 
+ After, enter `ls` and you should see the new directory. `cd` into it. 
+ Students do!

## Conclusion / So What?
+ Two words: Open Source. There are over eight million people who use GitHub to store their code. Having a free account on GitHub means that anyone in the community can fork or clone your repositories and make changes to or contribute to your codebase. It's all about people building publicly accessible applications together.

## Hints and Hurdles
+ Visuals can be very helpful in explaining forking and cloning. Draw the workflow on the board:

+ Version control explanation using video game analogy works well.

## Off Screen Fun
+ Take breaks for games and team building. Here are a bunch of [games we love](https://docs.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/document/d/1SWyV9LjCEnV89Zbly-Zfgoy7ZiofSWoo3QGfwvJDc64/).
