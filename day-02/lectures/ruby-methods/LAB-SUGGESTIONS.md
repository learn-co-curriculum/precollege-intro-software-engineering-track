# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Flyover` - This lab can be tedious but is good practice in method syntax.

+ `Parrot` - This lab is good practice in defining a method that accepts one argument, two arguments, and three arguments.

+ `Mother's Day` - This lab allows students to practice defining methods with no arguments, with one argument, with default arguments, and multiple arguments.

+ `Meal Choice` - This lab practices writing methods with default arguments.

+ `Stretch - Speaking Grandma` - This lab requires students to practice if-else statements. This is good for students who need a little stretch because we haven't formally covered conditionals. This lab also has bonus components that deal with string manipulation.

+ `Stretch - Itsa Mario!` - This lab is a stretch lab from Harvard's Intro Computer Science class (CS 50). This lab is good for students who have a decent amount of programming experience prior to Flatiron (students who have taken AP computer science, or have a solid base in another programming language).
