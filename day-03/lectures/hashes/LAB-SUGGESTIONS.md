# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Recipe Hash` - This lab has students practice retrieving data from hashes, adding key-value pairs from hashes, and iterating over a hash

+ `Weather Forecast` - This lab uses an API (Weather Underground) and has students practice retrieving data from a hash, as well as iterating over a hash.

+ `Music Library` - This lab has students practice using the `each_key` and `each_value` method to iterate over a hash, as well as delete a key-value pair and add a key-value pair.

+ `Stretch Lab: Hashketball` - This lab is great for really advanced students. This lab is pulled directly from the Flatiron adult course, and is known to be really challenging even for the adults. Framed that way, this can be a really awesome challenge for highly advanced and motivated students.

+ `Stetch Lab: Apples and Holidays` - This lab is also directly from the Flatiron adult course. Not as challenging as Hashketball, this lab should still be used as stretch material.
