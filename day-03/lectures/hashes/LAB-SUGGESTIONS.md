# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Recipe Hash` - This lab has students practice retrieving data from hashes, adding key-value pairs from hashes, and iterating over a hash

+ `Weather Forecast` - This lab uses an API (Weather Underground) and has students practice retrieving data from a hash, as well as iterating over a hash.
