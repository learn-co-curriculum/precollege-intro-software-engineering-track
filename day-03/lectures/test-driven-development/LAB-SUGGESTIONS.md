# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `TDD Code Along` - This lab is great for use during lecture to teach TDD. There are enough tests that you can walk students through the first few and then let them work on their own.
           
+ `Sweet Ride Bro` - This lab is great practice for TDD.
