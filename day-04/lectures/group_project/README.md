#GROUP PROJECT:
+ **Challenge:** Build a Command Line Calculator Application

+ **Group Size:** 3-4 students per group. Heterogeneous groups (mixing strong students with students that need more support). Teachers assign groups.

+ **Configurations:** Students at a big whiteboard table with one big screen to share.

## Best Practices
+ **Culture and Expectations:**
  * Dealing with frustration, this is important.
  * Working together is the only way to build amazing things.
  * Importance to employers - the ability to collaborate and cooperate. This is the first thing that employers ask about. Employers don’t care if you’re a good coder if you can’t work together effectively.
  * Communication - What works (listening, thoughtful responses)
  * We are a coder COMMUNITY. We don’t put others down. We help and bring people up. And this goes for life, too.
  * Humility.

+ **Classroom Management:**
  + Speak in terms of positive. A successful coder… Make it aspirational.
  + Positive reinforcement.
  + Relate to the real world..

+ **Logistics:**
  * Whiteboard tables, big screens
  * Rules around presentation. There is a time for questions, after the main presentations.
  * Make sure questions are appropriate (What is an appropriate question?)
  * Presentation guidelines (length, explain one technical thing, one design decision, etc..)

+ **Presentation of challenge:**
  * Think about design decisions. There is no right or wrong. Just different ways of doing things, with tradeoffs…
  * We are empowering you to prioritize, so obviously you won’t be able to do everything.
  *There should be some modeling out as a group before the challenge.
  * Before coding starts there should be discussion of goals and a project plan.

+ **Implementation:**
  + Rotating the driver
  + After project is done, positive feedback is given.



## Intro: 
This time you’re building a command line calculator. Before you all dive into coding and working on your projects, it's going to be important to spend some time planning out how you want this to work. You all need to spend at least the first 5 minutes with computers down, just modeling out how you want the calculator to work. Feel free to use whiteboards to draw.

We’re going to have you guys using the big screens, so one person will drive at a time. You’ll want to rotate drivers, and make sure everyone gets a chance. People not driving are navigators and researchers. A navigator tells the driver what to type, and a researcher googles to figure out good approaches and technical syntax. 

Please keep in mind the concept of MVP (NOT most valuable player) - minimum viable product. This term as it relates to software development is the idea that you build the minimum features first before you start building out all the fancy cool things. You need the basic structure working first.

It’s important to keep in mind that every design and architecture decision has tradeoffs. You may decide to focus on error-handling, to protect your program from a stupid input a user may enter, but then you may not be able to handle 3 numbers in your math problems. You only have a little over an hour to build, so it’s important to map out the important features for you group,  while keeping in mind that that means some things won’t get built.

At the end, we’ll spend 30 minutes presenting projects. Each group will come up to the projector to demo their app and explain their approach.


## Presenting: 
Every group must present and every group member must go up to the front for the presentation. 

After presentations, there will be a time to ask each group questions about their project. Students should be guided to ask questions about the heart of each group’s design decisions and technical challenges.

Without telling students what kind of questions they can’t ask, student’s should be steered away from asking questions to break other groups apps or point out weak spots and bugs. The point is for students to feel proud of their accomplishments and build each other up, not drag each other down.
