# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Homer's Donuts` -  This Lab has students practice different number of branches of if-statements to help Homer Simpson stay on his diet. This lab scaffolds up starting with just a single `if` clause all the way up to several `if-elsifs-else`.

+ `Leap Year` - This lab has students practice using if statements to find all the leap years given a range of numbers. This lab is slightly advanced.

+ `Curfew Checker` - This lab has students build out several different curfew checkers, with increasing level of difficulty.

+ `Ceasar Cipher`  - This lab is a stretch lab for really advanced students. This lab is taken from Harvard's CS50 and is designed to be a really great challenge for students who have taken AP CS or have significant experience with prior programming languages.

+ `Regex Rally` - This lab is about regular expressions. Regular expressions are an advanced programming topic and should only be given to students who have significant prior programming experiences
