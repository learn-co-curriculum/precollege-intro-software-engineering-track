# DAY-05 Git Part 2 

_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

## SWBATs
+ Understand the purpose of Git and GitHub, commit locally, and push to a remote repository.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ You've been using GitHub to fork and clone code to your local computers, as well as add, commit and push up your work. The real power of GitHub comes in the form of version control and hosting your code in the cloud. Version control makes it possible to save snapshots of your work over time, so that you can go back to different snapshots if you mess something up down the line. You can __push__ these snapshots, also known as __commits__, to GitHub so that they can be accessed from anywhere, allowing for collaboration with other developers.

## Lesson Plan
+ Explain difference between Git and GitHub.
+ Pull up a practice lab and make some changes to it.
+ Explain and model:
  + `git add`
  + `git commit -m "Your message here."`
  + `git status`
  + `git log`
  + `git push origin master`
+ Show students that the GitHub repo has been updated.
+ Explain and model a __pull request__.

## Conclusion / So What?
+ Now that you have the full power of Git and GitHub at your fingertips, collaborating with other developers is fully within your capabilities. This means you can work on some of the hottest coding projects out there, like Rails or Sinatra, and submit pull requests that could result in your code being incorporated into the code base. And when it comes to applying for coding jobs down the road, employers love to see that you've contributed to open source projects.

## Hints and Hurdles
+ `git add/commit/push` - FREEZE everyone and have them do this every 15 minutes to build up the muscle memory.
+ Not all students will need to/want to work with a full GitHub workflow. Consider introducing more advanced GitHub topics if you have extra time and think that it won't distract from getting work done on projects.
+ Alternative options for students is to work off of one repository with one main branch and put code from other's computers in a Google doc or send over e-mail. 
+ Do not worry about teaching branches. Some students may want this material, and it's a great advanced concept for students who get there on their own, but it shouldn't be part of the main lesson.
