# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

### Labs:

+ `Garden Gnome` - Students LOVE this lab. This lab has students practice basic OO syntax by building a Gnome class.

+ `Detention Lab` - This lab has students practice basic OO syntax.

+ `My Pets` - This lab is scaffolded to increase in complexity. Students build out four different classes Dog, Cat, Fish, Owner.

+ `OO Banking` - This lab is a stretch lab, designed for students with prior OO experience. This lab comes from the adult course. It's a great challenge to potentially humble an over confident student, or provide the right amount of difficulty for a student that has been hard to challenge.
