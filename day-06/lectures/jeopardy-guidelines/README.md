##DAY-06 Jeopardy Guidelines

You may be familiar with the popular television trivia game show Jeopardy starring host Alex Trebek. We've designed a Jeopardy game with Ruby trivia that will help students review the key concepts covered in past lectures and work together to problem solve. Feel free to tweak the game play to meet your class' needs. 


###Game Setup

+ Copy the Jeopardy slideshow [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-5CHVXuU9VmhtIGZjTjzqlQpn-TXgGxWgEkdeQ8EEwE/edit#slide=id.p4) and choose a final Jeopardy question. You may want to make this one history of code or other non-code trivia (like show a picture of Yukihiro Matsumoto and ask students who he is and why he's notable) so that any groups that fall behind have a chance to get a high point question. Decide how long students should have to answer -- it may vary depending on the type of question. 

+ Break up the class into teams of 3-4 students

+ Have each team come up with a fun team name

+ Pass out mini whiteboards -- students must put down their answer on the whiteboard

+ This is a laptops closed activity, but you may want to allow one laptop per group to be open to Google as needed. A few questions cover hash/array methods students may not have been exposed to yet. 

+ Set up one teacher at the laptop to serve as Alex Trebek and another to keep score and time for the class. 

+ Choose timing for each question 100 and 200 category questions require about 1-2 minutes minute. 300 and 400s need about 2-3 minutes. 500s need about 3-4 minutes to answer. 

+ Every group should try to answer every question. This maximizes student participation. Every group that gets the answer right gets those points added to their total, but if a group gets the answer wrong, the points are subtracted from their total.


###How to Play

+ Rock paper scissors, pick out of a hat, or choose a team to start

+ Each team chooses a category and point amount. Questions with hire score amounts are hire difficulty than questions with lower score amounts.

+ Once the team has chosen put the question up on the screen and start the timer for the alotted time amount. 

+ Students work together on a solution and their final answer must be written on a white board. In true Jeopardy style students should phrase the answer as a question. Example: "What is a getter?"

+ When time runs out or if the answer is wrong, other students can "steal" the question for points and pu but they must answer immediately afterward so that they don't have an unfair advantage of extra time or help from other groups wrong answer.

+ Show the answer and give out points. If students don't quite get the exact correct answer, but were close use your judgement to give partial credit points. 

+ Rotate which group picks the questions instead of letting the winners continue to pick until someone else wins a round. This way groups with more advanced students don't just take up all the points and everyone can feel like they get a chance to answer. 

+ Once all the questions have been picked put up the final Jeopardy question.  

+ Declare a team as winners, and give kudos to all the teams.
