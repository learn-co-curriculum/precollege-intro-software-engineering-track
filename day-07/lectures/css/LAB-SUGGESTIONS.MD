# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

###Option 1:

**For Lecture Time:** Build on the personal website from the HTML lecture to add styling.

**For Lab Time:** 
Below is a list of labs in order from easiest to hardest (and crowd pleaser's listed first)
+ My Little Rainbow - easy win for students
+ CSS Gems - practices CSS selectors.
+ Empire State Challenge 
+ CSS Issue Bot - familiarizes students with W3C CSS validator
+ Grafitti Override - advanced CSS selectors and CSS inheritance
+ Kitten Wheelbarrow - advanced CSS selectors
+ Zetsy - total page from specs (like professional developer)
+ Animal Save - stretch lab on responsive design


###Option 2:

**For Lecture Time:** Pick a funny topic and have students do the same to practice HTML and CSS

**For Lab Time:** Have students [build their own website](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/hs-ruby1-my-website) and deploy to GH pages instead of working on Labs
