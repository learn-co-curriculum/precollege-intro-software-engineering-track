# DAY-07 HTML/CSS Group Project 

## SWBATs
+ Build a multi-page Choose Your Own Adventure game website

## Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ You learned about HTML and CSS, now it's time to put this new knowledge to the test. The best way to solidify a new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you've learned.
+ So far, we've done a lot of HTML and CSS work that involves building out sites from specs, meaning we've gotten the designs from someone else. This exercise is going to combine the skills we've learned from those exercises with our own creative chops.

## Lesson Plan
OVERVIEW
+ In this challenge, each group must design and build their own Choose Your Own Adventure story.  This challenge will have three parts:
1. Writing the story and it's different paths
2. Designing what the pages will look like
3. Actually writing the code to make a page look like your group's designs
+ Instructor should demo and explain storyboarding and wireframing back to back and then let students run with both. It's hard to let them run to storyboard and then pull them back in for a wireframing lesson.
+ Give students their groups before demoing wireframes and storyboarding.
  + Group Size: 3-4 students per group. Heterogeneous groups (mixing strong students with students that need more support). Teachers assign groups.

STORYBOARDING 
+ Each group needs: a Gliffy account, a whiteboard and markers, and one laptop.
+ Explain what a storyboard is.
+ Explain how to storyboard using Gliffy. They also can just storyboard by writing on a whiteboard, if they prefer.
  + Gliffy login: hs@flatironschool.com password: 33west26
  + Show example file called _Storyboard demo_, which is saved in Gliffy.
  + Show students how to use Gliffy to put squares and lines and text on page.
+ When storyboarding with Gliffy, students should select a "flowchart".
+ Show students examples of other Choose Your Own Adventure Games, like [this one](http://www.thing.org/projekte/7:9%23/queneau_1.html).

WIREFRAMING (20 minutes)
+ Each group needs: a Gliffy account, a whiteboard and markers, and one laptop.
+ Explain what a wireframe is.
+ Explain how to wireframe using Gliffy. They also can just wireframe by writing on a whiteboard, if they prefer.
  + Gliffy login: hs@flatironschool.com password: 33west26
  + Show example file called _Wireframe demo_, which is saved in Gliffy
  + Use Gliffy to put shapes and text on page. Demo adding pages (can select File < New OR just put new page directly below)


BUILDING
+ Students should start to first brainstorm topic for their story. What themes do they want to focus on? Students should spend 5 minutes brainstorming with computers closed and whiteboards.
+ Storyboarding - Each group needs to first come up with their opening sentence. It's the single most important sentence of the story.
+ Storyboarding - The text for the two different paths needs to be short. You want to intrigue your reader with a glimpse of where the paths will lead them, without giving it all away until they click and choose.
+ Wireframing - Should should spent 10 minutes thinking about how they will interact with the site. Will they click links? Buttons? Nav bar? to move to different sections of the story.
  + What will the header and footer look like?    
  + Where do text, buttons, images, and links go in relation to the header and footer and each other?
+ Wireframing -  Once these questions are answered, students should spend 15 minutes drawing a wireframe for their story on a whiteboard or Gliffy.

PRESENTING
+ Every group must present and every group member must go up to the front for the presentation. 
+ After presentations, there will be a time to ask each group questions about their project. Students should be guided to ask questions about the heart of each group's design decisions and technical challenges.
  + Without telling students what kind of questions they **can't** ask, student's should be steered away from asking questions to break other groups apps or point out weak spots and bugs. The point is for students to feel proud of their accomplishments and build each other up, not drag each other down. 

### Conclusion / So What?
+ This is a good activity to get the students working in groups as a lead up to the final group projects. As developers, you rarely work in a vacuum, so being able to collaborate effectively with others is key to being a successful developer.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ Remind students that HTML/CSS is a lot of playing and messing around and figuring things out by trial and error.
+ Make sure that group sizes for project aren't too big - 4 people MAX.
+ For advanced students, set minimum requirements: as long as you can do XYZ, then you can do JS, but you need to be able to explain basics first and have your partner explain them, too.
