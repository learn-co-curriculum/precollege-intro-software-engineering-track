# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to choose from?

###Option 1:

**For Lecture Time:** Have students build a personal website during lecture time as they practice tags.

**For Lab Time:**
+ Album Cover - students love this lab. Make sure they do this first
+ Dev Tools Super Power - Students also love this. Let's them learn how to prank their friends by editing text in the browser. Sometimes students benefit from a teacher walking them through this lab.
+ HTML Playground - good for introductory material to let students make a Tumblr-like site and play with tags.
+ Issue Bot - Let's them play with the W3C Validator


###Option 2:

**For Lecture Time:** Pick a funny topic and have students do the same to practice HTML and CSS

**For Lab Time:** Have students [build their own website](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/hs-ruby1-my-website).
