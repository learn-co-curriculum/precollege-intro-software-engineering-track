## DAY-08 Ideation 

### SWBATs
+ Understand the brainstorming and design process and decide on an idea for their final project.

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ We’ve all been in the situation where we want to make something, but are totally overwhelmed by the blank page. The blinking cursor of nothingness. It’s totally daunting. Since we’re going to start working on our final projects, we’re going to first tackle the brainstorming process so that we have a few potential projects that we can work on. The point of this course is to learn to build web applications, combining front-end programming with back-end programming, but you can't build an application about nothing. You need a good idea, first!

### Lesson Plan
+ We started this class building input-output command line applications with puts and gets. We talked about how that process of user input, data manipulation and then output is a pattern that drives the web. For your final project, we're going to use this same pattern to build a utility application. 
  * Examples of apps like this: 
    *Google Translate 
    * [Astrology Zone: Matchmaker by Sign](http://www.astrologyzone.com/main.html)
+ These sites don't change over time - every time you refresh, you have the same experience.

+ Some examples built by other students are:
  * [Erin and Priya](http://moodmusic-fi.herokuapp.com)
  * [Clarence and Fiona](http://breaking-as.herokuapp.com/)
  * [Caroline](http://monogram-maker.herokuapp.com)
  * [Malachi and Jovan](http://which-fruit-are-you.herokuapp.com)
+ Explain the constraints of the project by showing different applications previous students had built that use the technologies that students will be able to utilize in their applications. 

+ At a MINIMUM we want students to walk away with a strong understanding in MVC. Anything beyond that is gravy.
  * For really strong students (after they master a basic MVC app in Sinatra), you can direct them towards several pre-approved APIS. Do not mention the use of APIs in the ideation.
    * ***NB:*** APIs are only to be used by very advanced students and ONLY AFTER they have a working application without using them.

1. Ideate (~1h)
  + Problem brainstorm:
    + On the board, create four categories: Friends and family, School, Community, World. 
    + Have students write down as many ideas as possible on post-it notes for three minutes for each of the following segments:
      + What are some problems you experience with your friends or family?
      + What are some problems you experience at school?
      + What are some problems you experience in your community (city)?
      + What are some problems you want to address in the world?
    + Following each segment, have the students take their post-its up to the board.  Have them take 10 minutes to  organize into teams around a problem they find interesting.
  + Solution brainstorm
    + Once students are organized into groups, have them clarify who their end-user will be.  Who are they building this app for? How do they currently solve this problem? What are the shortcomings of current solutions? Have each group share their use case.
    + Have students take 3 minutes to write down as many solutions to their groups problems as possible individually.
    + If teams of 4 have students partner up and take an additional 3 minutes to share and refine ideas.
    + Have teams come together and share ideas and pick their favorite solution. 
2. Refine
  + Have students take 15 minutes to refine their idea.
  + Have students write out three clear use cases for their app/solution.

### Conclusion / So What?
+ You're on your way to becoming a master coder! But no programmer knows everything there is to know about programming. There is ALWAYS more to learn. Figure out what it is about coding that you love, and dig as deep as you can into that topic to better understand it. If you love Sinatra, grab a book on it or read the documentation to learn how exactly Sinatra works under the hood. If you want to build up your Ruby skills, head over to Project Euler to practice with tricky algorithmic problems. The resources are boundless, so keep on learning!

### Hints and Hurdles
+ Remind students that we only have x hours left of class. They need to focus on MVP and getting this done in a short amount of time.
+ Give students an action item for next class for their project, so they will come to class with something to build upon.
+ Assign teachers to work with specific groups throughout project mode.
+ Time limits for ideation are great. You don't want to let them spend too much time agonizing over their ideas.
