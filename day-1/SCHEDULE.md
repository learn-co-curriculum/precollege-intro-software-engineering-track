This is just a suggested schedule. Improv shouldn't take up a full half hour and lunch can be cut down if more time is needed for lectures/labs/projects.

+ 9 - 10:00 Intros
+ 10:00 - 10:30 Navigating the Command Line
+ 10:30 - 11:30 Environment Set Up
+ 11:30 - 12:00 Intro to Ruby
+ 12:00 - 1:00 Lunch (pizza!)
+ 1:00 - 2:50 Ruby data types and labs (pause 30 minutes for improv where needed)
