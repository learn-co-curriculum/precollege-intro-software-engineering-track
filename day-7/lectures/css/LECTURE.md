### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ Pull up Justin Bieber's (or your celebrity of choice) Twitter with all the stylesheets unlinked using Developer Tools. Explain that this is his website with JUST HTML. Enable different pieces of CSS to show how the style changes.
+ They say don't judge a book by its cover, but a poorly designed website can be a big turnoff for a user who can easily navigate away from it with the click of a button. CSS is the key to getting your page looking good, and that will keep people coming back to your site again and again. The more professional and well-designed your site is, the more likely users are to take it seriously.
+ Explain that we write CSS in separate files, so that each file in our website has one job and one job only.

### Lesson Plan
+ Start with CSS walkthrough on the screen, showing the uncompleted and completed versions, [found here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/css-walkthrough-hs).
+ Students fork and clone walkthrough and open `index.html` in browser and Sublime.
+ Link CSS file to HTML file with `<link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=”css/style.css”>`.
+ Make h1 tags larger and change the font to blue with `h1 {font-size: 40px; color: blue;}`.
+ Change h2 font size and color with hexadecimal colors.
+ Change kid meme to be centered with a green border using border-style, border-color, and a div wrapper around the image with `class=”center-image”` attribute and `.center-image {text-align: center;}` in CSS.
+ Change font to Wingdings using `<div id=”welcome”>` in HTML and Google fonts.
+ Change background color to red and font color to white.
+ Review using ids and classes to style chunks of code.
+ Show students [references they can use](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) to look up other CSS properties.

### Conclusion / So What?
+ Congratulations! You now have both front-end and back-end skills in your web development arsenal. You just about know everything you need to know to build your own web application. Now you just have to put them all together. The key to getting your front-end to play nicely with the back-end is a Ruby framework called Sinatra.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ Feel free to give students an introduction to Bootstrap during this class. Emphasize that it's important to be able to write HTML and CSS by hand, but that Bootstrap allows us to easily style our websites since not every developer has the design skills necessary to make something look snazzy.
