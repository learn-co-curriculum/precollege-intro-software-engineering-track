## Unit 8: Ideation - Lecture Notes

### SWBATs
+ Understand the brainstorming and design process and decide on an idea for their final project.

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
+ We’ve all been in the situation where we want to make something, but are totally overwhelmed by the blank page. The blinking cursor of nothingness. It’s totally daunting. Since we’re going to start working on our final projects, we’re going to first tackle the brainstorming process so that we have a few potential projects that we can work on. The point of this course is to learn to build web applications, combining front-end programming with back-end programming, but you can't build an application about nothing. You need a good idea, first!

### Lesson Plan
+ Explain the constraints of the project by showing different applications previous students had built that use the technologies that students will be able to utilize in their applications. 
  + Scraping
    + [WordBattlr](http://wordbattlr.herokuapp.com/) - Scrapes Google results (also uses forms).
    + [Fortune Generator](http://fortune-generator.herokuapp.com) - Scrapes a website of fortunes to generate different results. (Click on the fortune cookie for your fortune!)
  + Forms
    +  [Tweet Counter](https://stormy-crag-3017.herokuapp.com/) - Uses forms and Twitter API.
  + APIs
    + [Flatiron Music Project](https://flatiron-music-project.herokuapp.com/) - Uses Spotify API and forms to create a Pandora clone.
+ If you want, you can guide students through the "Innovation by Design" methodology developed by David Kelley at IDEO in Palo Alto, CA. They’re one of the most influential design firms in the world and their methodology has been extremely successful.

1. Let’s pick out our audience. Who are we making this for?
+ In the real world we would do a market study. We’d really get to know who these people are. For our purposes, let’s pick one person or group of people we know (it could be ourselves) and take a moment to think about them. What do they like? What makes them happy? What do they hate? What would make their lives easier? What problems do they have? Have students pick a demographic and follow through these steps.

2. Let’s brainstorm. Act like a beginner. Pretend there are no constraints. For 5 minutes come up with as many ideas as you can. There are no wrong answers. Just keep adding ideas, don’t think. Add ideas to post-it notes or whiteboard.

3. Let’s consider out our constraints. We talked about this earlier.

4. Let’s pick out potential projects that we like/might fit from our list. For each project explain it to a partner or group. Get their feedback. Listen to their ideas. Have students brainstorm project ideas on their own and come up with 3 possibilities.
  + Remind them that between now and the end of class they’ll have about 10 hours of time with teacher help. So that means they should think carefully about the scope of their project.

5. Let’s build a mockup/prototype. Use whiteboards and wireframing to think through the design and functionality.

6. Pitch to groups and get feedback on the idea.
+ Get students to mingle around and talk to their friends and tablemates about their different ideas to start to form groups.

### Conclusion / So What?
+ You're on your way to becoming a master coder! But no programmer knows everything there is to know about programming. There is ALWAYS more to learn. Figure out what it is about coding that you love, and dig as deep as you can into that topic to better understand it. If you love Sinatra, grab a book on it or read the documentation to learn how exactly Sinatra works under the hood. If you want to build up your Ruby skills, head over to Project Euler to practice with tricky algorithmic problems. The resources are boundless, so keep on learning!

### Hints and Hurdles
+ Remind students that we only have 10 hours left of class. They need to focus on MVP and getting this done in a short amount of time.
+ Give students an action item for next class for their project, so they will come to class with something to build upon.
+ Assign teachers to work with specific groups throughout project mode.
+ Time limits for ideation are great. You don't want to let them spend too much time agonizing over their ideas.
